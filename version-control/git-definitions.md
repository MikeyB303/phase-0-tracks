# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? - Version control is the task of recording changes to your project files. It is useful because it allows you and teammates to look back at all the changes made to the project and understand what direction it's taking.

* What is a branch and why would you use one? - Branches give you a copy of your project to work on. They are used to work on different pieces of a project without changing the project as a whole.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? - a commit is like a save point for your project. A good commit message should be short, concise, and explain what changes have been made.

* What is a merge conflict? - occurs when two branches have made changes to the same part of the same file and then merged together.
